Currently, my casino application can play both Blackjack and Roulette fairly well, and I have not noticed any major bugs. The majority of the last few days were spent working on tests and trying to optimize/clean-up the code as much as possible. I still believe I'll be working on it for the remainder of the day but it will mostly be smaller changes I believe. I had lots of fun working with a more complicated version of Project 4 and I wish I could have done everything that I planned on doing from the beginning, but making sure every use case was accounted for in both games took a lot longer than previously thought. Had I had more time, I would have made the experience more personal for the player when they log in and add more functionality such as a Casino Bank and/or more games.

In regards to code that I used from other places, I was heavily influenced by some of the HumanPlayer hangman code from lab four, at least in terms of structure, and the github repo blackjack-elixir by thomascchen. That repo, although structured very wrongly for what I was trying to do, helped me understand some basic fundamentals that I was having issue with and I'm sure some of my basic code (such as my Deck suites data structure) look similar to that.
